This is a website for the COMSCI2 students 2025

🤝 Show your support - give a ⭐️ to this project if you liked the content 

Inside it there are a few .html pages
whatson
 - is the page that I built at first to make sure that all the containers were the same and something for them to build off of.
index
 - the main page intro &  disclaimer. 
deadlines
 - comprised of 2 parts #homework and any pertinent #deadlines/ important dates of note. 
 - homework is the normal weekly homework / quizes that we need to complete by a certain date. This rarely changes unless the lecturer adds something that will then comtinue for the rest of the semester
 - deadlines is a week by week section that I would like to be able to togglt a week number and below will be the exams etc sorted by time and date
   - NOTE TO SELF: MAYBE SPLIT HOMEWORK AND DEADLINES ONTO 2 PAGES?
   - OR IF LOOKING AT IT ON A WEBSITE HAVE HOMEWORK LEFT COL, DEADLINES RIGHT, SIDE BY SIDE?
modules
 - is not complete yet, this is something that I will come back to in second semester
 - plan is that it will list the following
   - course name
   - lecturer name
   - lecturer email
   - a breakdown of the exams and their weights
   - code to search for the past exam papers, or maybe I'll donload the pdf's and make them available directly here

Below are the current pages. The "..." are aspirational. I would like to get these done

Extra: 
 - add a counter to see how many times the site is viewed.

 - Create a survey for the lecturers that they can fill out of the fAQs (look at devops wk 11 to see where the idea came from)
