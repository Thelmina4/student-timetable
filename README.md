Inside it there are a few .html pages
index

whatson
 - is the page that I built at firat to make sure that all the containers were the same and something for them to build off of.
deadlines
 - the page is comprised of 2 parts our #homework and any pertinent #deadlines/ important dates of note. 
 - homework is the normal weekly homework / quizes that we need to complete by a certain date. This rarely changes unless the lecturer adds something that will then comtinue for the rest of the semester
 - deadlines is a week by week section that I would like to be able to togglt a week number and below will be the exams etc sorted by time and date

 - plan is that it will list the following
   - course name
   - lecturer name
   - lecturer email
   - a breakdown of the exams and their weights
   - code to search for the past exam papers, or maybe I'll donload the pdf's and make them available directly here
